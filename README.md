## Description
This project allows to the user to generate a README file combining require, inquirer, and html.

- In this project we are using the MySQL2 package Links to an external site.to connect to our MySQL database and perform queries, the Inquirer package Links to an external site to interact with the user via the command line, and the console table package Links to an external site to print MySQL rows to the console.
- A file is created which contains our database credentials. Making sure that our MySQL password is not used for any other personal accounts, otherwise it will be visible on GitHub. 
- Part of this project is to make our queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a promise() function on Connections to upgrade an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises.
